    "This project is about electing the best place for a restaurant in Paris.Due to the density of population in Paris, there is a lot of restaurants cafe and bistro  everywhere.\n",
    "The huge metropolitan has many neighborhoods and the success of a restaurant depends in part in the location. Paris has 20 neighborhood which I investigated in this project  and I used different criteria to reduce the number of possible location to two  and then to an optimal one. This project is of interest to the restaurant owners or future owners. It gives a good idea of the cost of neighborhood and their most common venues.This is important because if you choose for example to open a fast food place it would be better located near a university or offices however if it is a fine cuisine restaurant so better go with residential neighborhood or a fashion/shopping street.\n"
